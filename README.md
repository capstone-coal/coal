Coal and Open-pit surface mining impacts on American Lands

# Introduction and Context
Mountain-top Mining (MTM) is a method of open surface mining with the primary aim of exploring and exploiting coal seams present within the land and solid earth (LSE) on mountaintops. Amongst other surface mining activities, MTM is known to be an extremely destructive mining procedure predominantly limited to the spatial boundaries of the Southern Appalachians (Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and very small sections of Virginia and Tennessee). MTM is known to have caused irreparable damage to mountain landscapes and significant immediate and longer-term damage to key streams and watersheds. Larger afield, the rest of the U.S.A has some extensive surface mining in various places for exploitation of resources such as gravel/sand, various metals, other minerals and even radioactive materials, etc. Several studies have provided important scientific understanding related to the local, regional and state-level impacts of such environmentally destructive practices, however a similar understanding on the national and continental levels are very much lacking.

# Project Motivation & Statement 
coal provides a suite of algorithms (written in Python) to identify, classify, characterize, and quantify (by reporting a number of key metrics) the direct and indirect impacts of MTM and related destructive surface mining activities across the continental U.S (and further afield). More information on coal can be seen at the [project Website](http://lewismc.github.io/coal) as well as the [docs](./docs) directory.

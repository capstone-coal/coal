Microscopic characters:  Porphyritic texture.  The phenocrysts are serpentine
pseudomorphs after pyroxene and olivine, and phlogopite, with many nearly
euhedral grains present.  Magnetite is abundant.  The groundmass is an
aggregate of serpentine, phlogopite, chlorite and carbonate.  Pyrite and
occasional garnet are accessories.

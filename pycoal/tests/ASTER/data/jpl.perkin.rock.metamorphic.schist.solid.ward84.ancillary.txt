Microscopic characters:  Porphyroblastic, schistose texture.
Subhedral metacrysts of garnet and brown pleochroic staurolite
are quite common.  The staurolite crystals usually contain
numerous inclusions of graphite.  Muscovite, quartz and
cordierite are plentiful.  Graphite is also abundant in the slide.
Biotite is often associated with the garnet.  There is some 
chlorite and kyanite is present in some sections.

Mineral:  Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18

Sample No.: beryl.2

XRD Analysis:  Pure beryl.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that grains selected were 
homogeneous within and between grains.  An average of 7 analyses 
lacking beryllium indicates silica and alumina content appropriate 
for beryl:

SiO2 	64.62
Al2O3	17.20
FeO	0.17
MgO	0.05
CaO	0.01
K2O	0.03
Na2O	0.72
TiO2	0.01
MnO	0.00

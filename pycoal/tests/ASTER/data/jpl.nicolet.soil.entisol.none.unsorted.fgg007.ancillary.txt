Red-orange sandy loam/alluvium with 47% finer than 20 um (22% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of kaolinite and/or 
montmorillonite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this alluvium consisted of 
72% quartz, 10% illite/muscovite, 8% kaolinite and 7% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg007 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.35 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 12.85 
um, and the presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine grained 
quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened longer 
wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.35 um. The absorption feature at 
8.95 um, shoulder-peak at 9.865 um and rise at 11 um is suggestive of kaolinite.

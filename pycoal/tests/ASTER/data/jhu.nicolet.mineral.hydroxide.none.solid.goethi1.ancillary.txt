Mineral:  Goethite a-Fe+3O(OH)

Sample No.: goethite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure goethite.

Chemistry:  Polish on grains used for microprobe analysis was very 
poor, making a good analysis difficult.  Five microprobe analyses 
indicated good homogeneity. Total is low, but composition agrees 
with that of goethite.  Considering its crystalline nature, we conclude 
that this is probably a relatively pure sample of goethite.

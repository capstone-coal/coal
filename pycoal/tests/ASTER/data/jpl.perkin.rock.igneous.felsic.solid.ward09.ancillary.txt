Microscopic characters:  Porphyritic texture.  The phenocrysts are principally plagioclase
with irregular inclusions of epidote.  There are a few quartz crystals and biotite flakes
altered to chlorite.  Apatite and magnetite occur as accessory minerals.  The ground-
mass is composed of a fine crystalline aggregate of quartz, feldspar, chlorite, magnetite
and leucoxene.

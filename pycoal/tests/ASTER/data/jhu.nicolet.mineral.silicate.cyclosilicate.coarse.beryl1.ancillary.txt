Mineral:  Beryl Be3Al2Si6O18

Sample No.: beryl.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure beryl.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that grains selected were 
homogeneous within and between grains.  An average of 10 analyses 
lacking beryllium indicates silica and alumina content appropriate 
for beryl:

SiO2 	66.12
Al2O3	17.36
FeO	0.48
MgO	0.17
CaO	0.01
K2O	0.03
Na2O	0.35
TiO2	 0.01
MnO	0.00	
Total	*84.53
*Without beryllium.

*Note the very strong CO2 band near 4.3 micrometers due to CO2 
trapped in axial channels.

Microscopic characters:  The section displays an anhedral granular fabric.
Plagioclase constitutes about 65 percent of the section, olivine and minor
pyroxene and magnetite constitute the other 35 percent.  Rims and fractures
in the olivine show alteration to brownish iddingsite.  Magnetite is abundant
in the olivine frequently forming exsolution patterns.

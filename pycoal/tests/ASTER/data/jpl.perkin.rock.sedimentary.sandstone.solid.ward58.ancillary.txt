Microscopic characters:  Clastic texture.  It consists of sub-angular grains
of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase and microcline together with a few flakes
of muscovite, small grains of zircon, pyrite and leucoxene.  The cement is 
often obsucred by dusty opaque material but is composed in part of calcite
and of argillaceous material in which sericite shreds and small quartz grains
may be recognized.

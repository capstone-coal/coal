Grey calcareous silty soil.

Clay mineralogy : XRD analysis indicated the presence of Fe Chlorite, 
illite/muscovite and calcite. PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of 
kaolinite and/or montmorillonite and calcite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg017 indicates the presence of a 
fine grained quartz texture by the strong presence a peak at 6.42 um and the 
residual reststrahlen features at 8.18 um and 8.625 um. The presence of calcite 
is also suggested by the spectral peak at 11.2 um.

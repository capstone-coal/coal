Microscopic characters:  Hypautomorphic-granular texture.  The most abundant
constituent is a microcline microperthite.  Large quartz grains show undulatory 
extinction.  A few individual grains of plagioclase occur.  Biotite and hornblende
are closely associated with magnetite, zircon and large grains of fluorite.

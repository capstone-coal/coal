Mineral:  Almandine Fe3+2Al2(SiO4)3

File Name:  almand1a.txt

XRD Analysis:  Almandine with quartz and a small amount of chlorite 
according to XRD. Magnetic separation yielded a substantially quartz-
free magnetic fraction, which was used for microprobe analysis and 
spectra.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains, with typical almandine 
composition, accompanied by a minor amount of pyrope molecule.

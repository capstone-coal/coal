Microscopic characters:  Sub-angular and rounded pebbles and grains of quartz are
cemented by chalcedonic quartz.  The pebbles are in part composed of quartz 
showing undulatory extinction and in part made up of coarse granular aggregates
of quartz.  The cement is often stained with limonite and sometimes contains
muscovite and some argillaceous material.  Small grains of ilmenite are fresh
and others are altered to leucoxene.

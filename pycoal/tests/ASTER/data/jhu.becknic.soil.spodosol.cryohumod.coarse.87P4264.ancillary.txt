Extremely acidic (pH 4.0).  28.5% organic carbon, 0.04 % clay, 99.96% silt, 
0.0% sand.

Clay mineralogy: no mineral peaks present, indicating amorphous material 
(glass?).

Coarse mineralogy: 87% glass, 13% quartz.

Spectral description: This uppermost soil horizon is very rich in organic 
matter, which dominates the spectrum.  Strong H-C stretching vibration 
bands near 3.42 and 3.50 microns are accompanied by a broad, strong 
hydrocarbon absorption near 2.51 microns, weaker features near 2.27, 2.31 
and 2.35 microns, and a complex, ramped peak near 6.70 microns.  Organic 
matter also contributes to the broad reflectance peak near 11.7 microns, 
which may also be in part due to secondary volume scattering.  Quartz 
features can only be seen as weak combination tone bands near 5.08 and 
5.31 microns.  Because of the fine particle size and strong absorption by 
hydrocarbon, no reststrahlen bands are visible.

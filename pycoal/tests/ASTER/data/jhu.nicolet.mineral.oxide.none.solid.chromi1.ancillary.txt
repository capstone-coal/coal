Mineral:  Chromite Fe+2Cr2O4

Sample No.: chromite.1

XRD Analysis:  Chromite with minor talc and kaolin prior to cleaning, 
and substantially pure chromite afterwards.

Chemistry:  Volatile analysis by C. S. Papp, J. D. Sharkey, and K. J. 
Curry and XRF analysis of the non-volatiles by J. Taggare, A. Bartel, , 
XRF analysis by J. Taggart, A. Bartel and D. Diems, and ICP analysis of 
chromium by P. H. Briggs, USGS Branch of Analytical Chemistry, 
Denver, showed that some kaolinite remains in the sample, which 
accounts for the very weak hydroxyl band in the spectrum:

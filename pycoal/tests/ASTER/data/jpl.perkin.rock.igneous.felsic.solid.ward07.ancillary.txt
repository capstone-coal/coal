Microscopic characters:  Porphyritic texture.  The phenocrysts are quartz, sanidine,
sodic plagioclase, biotite and magnetite which is more or less completely altered
to hematite.  The groundmass is microcrystalline-granular, and slightly clouded by
iron oxide.  Numerous drawn-out air cells indicate flow structure.  There are a few
crystals of rutile.

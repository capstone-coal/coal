Microscopic characters:  Porphyritic texture with phenocrysts of plagioclase
and a few of hornblende in a very fine confused goundmass.  The plagioclase
phenocrysts are somewhat clouded due to alteration and show irregular albite
twinning.  In a few instances they show zonal development.  The hornblende
phenocrysts are partially altered to chlorite and calcite.  The groundmass is a
fine irregular aggregate of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase and green hornblende
with abundant secondary epidote, chlorite and clacite.  There are also
abundant magnetite grains and a few crystals of apatite.

Single grain, loose.  0.0% organic carbon; 0.0% clay, 100% sand.

Clay mineralogy: none.  

Coarse mineralogy: Chemical analyses indicate greater than 99% gypsum 
and a trace of quartz.

Spectral Description:  The spectral features seen are entirely those of 
gypsum.  Most features, such as the strong SO4 stretching peak near 8.7 µm, 
the weaker bending vibration peak near 14.9 µm, as well as the doublet near 
2.8 and 2.9 µm, are best displayed in our solid sample spectrum.  The rest of 
the minor absorption bands are seen in the spectrum of particulate gypsum.

Microscopic characters:  The character of the slide will vary with the different parts
of the rock.  The sandy shale phase is composed of sub-angular grains of quartz,
feldspar and muscovite with a small amount of magnetite and a calcareous cement.
The limestone areas consist of very fine-grained calcite cross-cut by irregular
stringers of calcite and chalcedonic quartz.  Red oxide of iron stain is quite
abundant.

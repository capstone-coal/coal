Mineral:  Cordierite Mg2Al4Si5O18

Sample No.: cordier.2

XRD Analysis:  The sample contains predominantly cordierite but is 
contaminated with another unknown mineral with a major peak at 
3.015 angstroms.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis found grains measured to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  Average of 9 analyses 
shows that this is not the pure magnesian end member of the series 
with sekaninaite, (Fe+2, Mg)2 Al4Si5O18:

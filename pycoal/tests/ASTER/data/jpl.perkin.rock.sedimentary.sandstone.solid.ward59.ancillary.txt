Microscopic characters:  Clastic texture.  It is composed of rounded grains of
clear quartz with a siliceous cement in which shreds of sericite occur.  The
cement is in part chalcedonic and in part in optical continuity with the original
grains.  In the latter case the cement is separated from the grains by a layer
of iron oxide.  A few small magnetite grains may be noted.

Microscopic characters:   Hypautomorphic-granular texture.  The feldspars
are soda orthoclase and oligoclase-andesine.  Augite with zonal habit
occurs as automorphic crystals, sometimes twinned or poikilitic with
biotite, magnetite and apatite.  Noselite may be recognized by its character
and numerous minute inclusions.  Sodalite and nephelite are also present. 
Kaolin, sericite, hornblende and chlorite are present as alteration products.

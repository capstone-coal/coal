Microscopic characters: Holocrystalline.  Saccharoidal texture.  The essential
minerals are quartz, microcline, orthoclase, microperthite and plagioclase.
Nearly half of the feldspar is sericitized.  Biotite is usually more or less completely
altered to chlorite, and magnetite to hematite.  Apatite grains and titanite are also
present.

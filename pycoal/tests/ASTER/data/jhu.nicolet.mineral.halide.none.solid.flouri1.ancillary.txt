Mineral:  Fluorite CaF2

Sample No.: fluorite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure fluorite.

Chemistry:  A chemical analysis is not available.  The transparency of 
the mineral suggests that it is quite pure. However, fluorite is so 
transparent in the infrared out to 17 micrometers that a small amount 
of water in fluid inclusions shows up rather prominently in the 
spectrum near 2.9 and 6.2 micrometers, and a very weak hydroxyl 
feature due to an unknown contaminant can be seen near 2.7 
micrometers in the spectrum of the finest size range.

Red-orange sandy soil containing a texture consisting of 22% finer than 20 um 
(8% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : XRD analysis indicates the presence of predominantly 
illite/muscovite with some kaolinite. 

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 79% 
quartz, 9% illite/muscovite and 5% kaolinite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg009 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.29 um), the minor presence of the doublet feature at 12.83 um, 
and the presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine grained quartz 
texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened and pronounced 
longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.29 um.

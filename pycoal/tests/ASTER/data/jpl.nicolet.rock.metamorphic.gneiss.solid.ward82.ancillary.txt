Name:  Granitoid Gneiss

Geologic Name:  None

Reference:  Watson, T.L., Granites of the southeastern Atlantic
States; U.S.G.S. Bull. 426, p. 137-143, 1910.

Microscopic characters:  Gneissic texture.  Sodic plagioclase,
microcline-perthite and quartz are the principle constituents.
The feldspars are usually bent or broken, indicating shearing.
Mosaic quartz details the gneissic texture by its position in
reference to the fledspar grains.  Large quartz grains have 
undulatory extinction.  There is a small amount of green chlorite,
garnet, magnetite and epidote.

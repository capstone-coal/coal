Mineral:  Epidote Ca2(Al,Fe+3)3(SiO4)3(OH)

Sample No.: epidote.1

XRD Analysis:  Epidote plus a trace of quartz.  (No quartz bands are 
apparent in the spectrum; however, spectral features due to a trace 
of carbonate were seen and the sample was given acid treatment to 
remove this contaminant.  As shown by the 4 micrometers carbonate 
band in reflectance spectra of the particulate samples, this treatment 
was not entirely successful.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains and to have typical epidote 
composition:

SiO2	37.14
Al2O3	23.05
FeO	14.5

Mineral:  Dolomite CaMg(CO3)2

Sample No.: dolomite.1

XRD Analysis:  XRD shows small peaks at 9.4 and 3.11 angstroms,  
indicating the presence of a very small amount of talc (not seen in IR 
spectrum).

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis of 6 grains showed homogeneous 
grain composition, a Ca/Mg ratio of 53.47/46.50, and only a trace of 
iron.  The analysis technique was not appropriate for CO3, but the 
cation abundances indicate a good dolomite.

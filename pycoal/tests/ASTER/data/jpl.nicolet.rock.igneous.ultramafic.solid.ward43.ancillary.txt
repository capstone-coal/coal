Microscopic characters:  In the thin section, the colorless fibrous bronzite 
constitutes most of the rock with smaller grains of diopside lying between
them.  The diopside is sometimes colorless and sometimes pale green
and pleochroic.  Small chromite grains are brownish in transmitted light 
but are almost opaque.

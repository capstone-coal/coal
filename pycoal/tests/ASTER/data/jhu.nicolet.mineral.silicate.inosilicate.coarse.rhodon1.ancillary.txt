Mineral:  Rhodonite (Mn+2,Fe+2,Mg,Ca)SiO3

Sample No.:  rhodon.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure rhodonite.

Hydoxyl may account in part for the low total for microprobe 
analysis, but rhodonite from Franklin also tends to contain zinc, 
which was not analyzed.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that the sample was 
homogeneous between and within grains, with typical rhodonite 
composition.  Average of six analyses:

SiO2	46.30
Al2O3	0.05
FeO	0.50
MgO	0.41
CaO	8.27
K2O	0.04
Na2O	0.28
TiO2	0.07
MnO	40.17

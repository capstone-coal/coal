Microscopic characters:  The whole slide is greatly obscured by
cloudy hematite.  It consists of a fine matrix of sericite and 
quartrz with occasional plagioclase and zircon.  There are oval 
patches of chalcedonic quartz and rhombs of carbonate throughout
the slide.  Some chlorite is associated with the sericite.  A few
small tourmaline prisms and crystals of pyrite may be noted.

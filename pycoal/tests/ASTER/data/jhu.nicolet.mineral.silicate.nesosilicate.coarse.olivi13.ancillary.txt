Mineral:  Olivine (Fo1) (Fe+2,Mg)2SiO4

Sample No.:  olivine.13

XRD Analysis:  Fayalite, with minor grunerite and kaolinite, but pure 
fayalite is rare, so we include the sample.  (Note very strong 
hydroxyl bands of contaminants near 2.7 micrometers.  OH probably 
accounts for the low total in microprobe analysis.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed that the sample contains an 
iron oxide phase and is apparently heterogeneous with respect to 
silica.  It has less than 1 mole percent fosterite.

Composition:

Petrographic Description:  Microphenocrysts of augite (some glomeropor-
phyritic) are set in a matrix of thin laths of labradorite, granular
clinopyroxene and dark, essentially opaque glass which is subordinate and
interstitial.  Some of the glass has been altered to a brown iron-rich
chlorite.  The modes gave 31% feldspar, 30% pyroxene, 31% groundmass, 
0.2% opaque and 7.8% miscellaneous (alteration products).

Microprobe Analysis:  The feldspar composition ranged from An67 to An74
(labradorite-bytownite); pyroxene phases probed were augite and pigeonite.

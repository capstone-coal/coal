Mineral:  Grossular Ca3Al2(Si04)3

Sample No.: grossul.2

XRD Analysis:  The sample is grossular but also yields a very small 
peak at 1.879 angstroms due to a trace of unknown contaminant.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed hand-picked grains to 
berelatively homogeneous, with only about a 1 wt % variation in FeO 
and CaO.  An average of 11 analyses indicates that this sample is a 
solid solution of grossulerite with andradite:

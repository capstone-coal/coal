Mineral:  Enstatite Mg2Si2O6

Sample No.: enstatite.1

XRD Analysis:  Enstatite plus a small amount of kaolinite and mica.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed some heterogeneity.  Six out 
of seven analyses were of enstatite bearing about 13% ferrosilite 
molecule.  One analysis had slightly over 2% CaO, with a concomitant 
decrease in MgO, whereas the other analyses had 0.5% CaO.  An 
average of the seven analyses:

SiO2 	56.70
Al2O3	1.69
FeO	4.97
MgO	35.25
CaO	0.85
K2O	0.02
Na2O	0.02
TiO2	0.01
MnO	0.15

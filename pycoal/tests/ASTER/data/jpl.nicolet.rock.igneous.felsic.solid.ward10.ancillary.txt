Microscopic characters:  Coarse hypautomorphic granular texture.  Microcline,
oligoclase, biotite, quartz, hornblende, and orthoclase are the essential constituents.
The biotite contains numerous pleochroic halos.  Some of the plagioclase is zoned.  
Sphene, apatite, magnetite and chlorite are the accessories.  The feldspar is partly
clouded with sericite and kaolin.

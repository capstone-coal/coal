Microscopic characters:  Holocrystalline porphyritic texture.  Phenocrysts of
green hornblende and andesine-oligoclase are abundant.  Quartz and biotite 
are less common.  Zoning of the feldspar is frequent and sericite is developed
along fractures of the feldspar.  Small crystals of apatite, grains of chalcedony
and colloform chalcedony are accessories.  The groundmass is fine grained
and composed chiefly of feldspar.

Mineral:  Magnetite Fe+2Fe2+3O4

Sample No.: magnet.1

Under the microscope, the sample appeared contaminated by <1% of 
some unidentified, clear to reddish brown material(s).

XRD Analysis:  Magnetite with minor kaolinitic contamination and, 
perhaps, some chlorite (?).  (The infrared spectrum is essentially that 
of pure magnetite and the microprobe analysis also indicates rather 
pure magnetite, so the mineral was retained in the library.)

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis indicates pure magnetite.  Average 
of eight analyses:

SiO2 	0.07
Al2O3	0.03
FeO	93.31
MgO	0.13
CaO	0.08
K2O	0.02
Na2O	0.03
TiO2	0.29

Total	*93.96
	*Low because no distinction made between ferrous and ferric 
iron in analysis.

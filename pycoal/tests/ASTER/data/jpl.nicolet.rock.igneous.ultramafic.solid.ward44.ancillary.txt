Microscopic characters:  The slide is composed of a mosaic of clear olivine
grains.  A small amount of serpentine occurs in the cracks of the olivine.
Stringers of carbonate, probably dolomite, wind across the section.  Crystals
and grains of chromite are slightly transparent and brown on the edges.  Flakes
of chlorite with anomalous brown interference colors are associated with the
chromite.  A small amount of fibrous cummingtonite may also be seen.

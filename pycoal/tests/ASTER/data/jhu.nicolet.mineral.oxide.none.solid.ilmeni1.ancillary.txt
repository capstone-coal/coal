Mineral:  Ilmenite Fe+2TiO3

Sample No.: ilmenite.1

XRD Analysis:  Pure ilmenite, with about 1% limonitic contamination 
on fracture surfaces.

Chemistry:  Ten microprobe analyses indicated that the mineral was 
homogeneous.  It is low in  titania and high in iron oxide, probably 
because of solid solution with hematite.

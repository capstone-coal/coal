Mineral:  Clinozoisite Ca2Al3(SiO4)3(OH)

Sample No.: clinozo.1

XRD Analysis:  Clinozoisite with a very small amount of possible 
mordenite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  It approaches epidote in 
composition due to high iron content.  Average of 10 analyses:

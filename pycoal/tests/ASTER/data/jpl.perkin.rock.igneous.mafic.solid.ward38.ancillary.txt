Microscopic characters:  Porphyritic texture with large phenocrysts of 
andesine-labradorite.  The groundmass is a rather confused aggregate
of plagioclase (andesine-labradorite), augite partially altered to uralite, 
and biotite partly altered to chlorite.  Titanite, a small amount of pyrite,
abundant magnetite, crystals of apatite and a few crystals of zircon 
constitute the accessory minerals.  There is a small amount of secondary
calcite.

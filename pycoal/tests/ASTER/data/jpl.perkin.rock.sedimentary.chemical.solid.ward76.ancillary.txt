Microscopic characters:  The oolites of red hematite are elliptical
in shape and have for nublei rounded grains of clouded quartz.  Around
this the hematite is built up in a narrow confocal elliptical zone.
The oolites are cemented by red hematite.  A small amount of chlorite
and calcite occur as secondary minerals in veins and stringers.
